- 👋 Hi, I’m @BUCHDA and am an ITD Teacher in Queensland Australia at the other end of my working life.
- 👀 I’m interested in new technologies and wish to remain a continual learner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything technologically interesting and would like to learn coding. Not there yet and very green. Can build computers though.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - not much at the moment as I am still feeling my way through a variety of technologies - bit shy in this area.
- 📫 How to reach me, I suppose, via email - buchda01@gmail.com
